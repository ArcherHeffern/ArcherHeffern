### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Archer!

**About me**

I'm studying Computer Science, minoring in Math and Business, at Brandeis University (Class of 2025). I'm currently working on <a href='https://branda.app/'>Branda</a>, an information app for Brandeis University used by over 90% of the campus. There I develop CI/CD pipelines and lead the development of components, integration, and end-to-end testing. I have also interned at Israeli tech startup , where I worked on a hybrid reality live sports game analyzer using computer vision. I have also been a Teaching Assistant for courses such as OOP and Data Structures and Algorithms.

 I have also interned at tech startups in the US and Israel, namely <a href='https://athletar.io/'>AthletAR</a> and <a href='https://www.inbe.io/' target='_blank'>InBe</a>, where I worked on a hybrid reality live sports game analyzer using computer vision and an advanced content indexing and recommendation system with system design and algorithms comparable to that of Google's.
