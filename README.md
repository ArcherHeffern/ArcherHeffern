### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Archer!

**About me**

I'm studying Computer Science, minoring in Math and Business, at Brandeis University (Class of 2025). I'm currently working on <a href='https://branda.app/' target='_blank'>Branda</a>, an information app for Brandeis University used by over 90% of the campus. There I develop CI/CD pipelines and lead the development of components, integration, and end-to-end testing. I have also interned at tech startups in the US and Israel, namely <a href='https://athletar.io/' target='_blank'>AthletAR</a> and <a href='https://www.inbe.io/' target='_blank'>InBe</a>, where I worked on a hybrid reality live sports game analyzer using computer vision and an advanced content indexing and recommendation system with system design and algorithms inspired by Google's. On top of that, I am also a Teaching Assistant for COSI 12b, "Advanced Progamming Techniques in Java".

Since starting my professional journey, I have developed a very strong interest in System Design, specifically in distributed systems. I am excited to continue my professional growth by pursuing a 12-week summer internship in this field. I am confident that my skills and passion for technology, combined with my hardworking and creative approach to problem-solving, make me a valuable asset to any organization. I am eager to gain new knowledge and perspectives on the industry while also making a meaningful contribution to the team.

Furthermore, I have been actively participating in several extracurricular activities such as hackathons and coding competitions, which have helped me to develop my skills and work in a team. In addition, I have a strong passion for sports and I have been a swimmer for Manhattan Makos, a competitive swimming team, for several years. This experience has taught me the importance of discipline, time management and teamwork.

I am also interested in the intersection of technology and business, and I am currently pursuing a minor in Business Administration. I believe that this combination of technical and business knowledge will allow me to bridge the gap between the two fields and be a valuable asset in companies where technology and business are closely related.

I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for a software engineering or project management internship, and I am excited to contribute to the success of a team and learn from experienced professionals in the industry. I look forward to hearing from potential employers and discussing how I can contribute to their organization.
